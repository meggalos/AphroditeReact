        General How can I change the amount of mail notifications I receive?
      </h3>

      <p>
        Mail notifications are e-mails sent to your e-mail address to alert you
        when you have a new view, a new message, a new connection... You can
        choose if you want to receive them or not. It's up to you, but remember:
        if your connection is visiting your profile, you might want to know
        about it immediately, don't you? You can always change your mail
        notification settings by going to Settings. Click the pencil icon next
        to 'Mail settings' and choose your preferred notification settings.
        Don't forget to save your changes!

      <h3>What is automated decision-making and profiling?</h3>

      <p>
        Europe's data protection framework, the General Data Protection
        Regulation ('GDPR'), provides the following definitions: - Automated
        individual decision-making: making a decision about an individual solely
        by automated means (i.e. using computers and algorithms only, without
        any human involvement in the decision-making process); - Profiling:
        evaluating certain things about an individual, including interests,
        preferences or behaviour, through an automated processing of personal
        data (e.g. using computers and algorithms to determine someone's
        interests based on his or her online behavior).
      </p><br/>

      <h3>Does Aphrodite rely on automated decision-making or profiling?</h3>

      <p>
        Automated decision-making and profiling are invisible features that are
        at the core of the services you know and love, upon which we constantly
        improve and without which we would be unable to help you build
        meaningful connections. We use these features for the following reasons:
        - To help connect you with other users. We use the information you and
        other users provide us (such as your profile), along with information we
        collect from your use of our service (like your location, should you
        allow us to collect it) and others’ use of the service, to power our
        best-in-class proprietary matching algorithms and recommend the most
        compatible profiles to you, based on a number of criteria, including the
        attributes you told us (or we noticed) you like, common interests, your
        search criteria and location. Of course, we use the same process to
        recommend your profile to other users. - To show you ads and offers that
        may be of interest to you. We use information about you to show you
        useful and relevant ads on and off our service and measure the
        effectiveness of these ads. We also use information about you to deliver
        offers and discounts tailored to your profile. To promote safety and
        security. We use automated decision-making and profiling as part of our
        moderation efforts (for example, removing bots), as well as to promote
        the safety and security of our users by making it easier to prevent
        illegal and unauthorised actions from happening and to swiftly and
        efficiently detect and fight those actions when they happen. This
        processing may have a significant impact on users found to be carrying
        out illegal or unauthorised activities, both on and off our services,
        including suspension and account closure, without prejudice to other
        legal actions we could take. Profile, Photo &#38; Video
      </p><br/>

      <h3>How do I delete a photo or video?</h3>

      <p>
        Go to your Profile and click the photo or video you want to delete.
        Click the three dots at the bottom and choose 'Delete'. Remember:
        deleting cannot be undone.
      </p><br/>

      <h3>How can I get access to someone’s personal photos or videos?</h3>

      <p>
        If someone has personal posts, you'll see a counter for personal photos
        &#38;#38; videos on his/her profile. Click it and ask permission to see
        those personal photos &#38; videos. A message will be sent to the
        person, requesting access to the personal posts. How many photos or
        videos can I add on my Aphrodite profile? We know that adding photos
        &#38;#38; videos on your Aphrodite profile is crucial for boosting your
        popularity on Aphrodite. That's why you can add as many as you like!
      </p><br/>

      <h3>How do I edit my profile?</h3>

      <p>
        Click on your avatar at the top right corner and click 'EDIT YOUR
        PROFILE INFO'. You can change your basic info (such as your name and
        location) and any additional info (your looks, your favourites...).
      </p><br/>

      <h3>I want to change my profile photo.</h3>

      <p>
        Changing your profile photo is really easy! Go to your profile page and
        hit the Edit icon next to your profile photo. Choose how you want to
        upload your new profile photo and follow the steps. You can also choose
        a new profile photo from your existing photos on Aphrodite. To do that,
        go to the photo you would like as your profile photo. Click the three
        dots at the bottom and choose 'Set as profile photo'. Remember that your
        profile photo needs to show your face in a clear and recognisable way.
        Your age and gender need to match your profile photo, and the photo
        cannot contain any nudity.
      </p><br/>

      <h3>I want to change my gender Due to safety reasons.</h3>

      <p>
        You cannot change your gender after your avatar got approved. If you
        don't have an approved avatar yet, you can change your gender once. If
        you made a mistake in your gender and you can't correct it yourself
        anymore, please contact the Help Desk so we can correct it for you.
      </p><br/>

      <h3>Do I have to fill out all profile questions?</h3>

      <p>
        No. You can answer as many or as few questions as you like. However, the
        more information you fill out, the easier it will be for us to find
        interesting people for you. As a guideline: give as much info as you
        would like to see from others. That's fair.
      </p><br/>

      <p>Go to your Aphrodite profile and click 'Add'. Follow the steps.

        in your Settings and click the 'Edit' icon. Select the people that no
        longer should have access to your personal posts and hit the 'Remove
        access' button.
      </p><br/>

      <h3>What photo format is allowed?</h3>

        content.

      <h3>
        What is the difference between profile photos, public photos and
        personal photos?
      </h3>

      <p>
        A profile photo needs to show your face in a clear and recognisable way.
        In your public folder, you can add all other photos you would like to
        share, except for nudity (bare buttocks, naked breasts...) Photos that
        contain nudity or that are erotic belong in your personal photos set.
        Explicit nudity (genitals, anuses...) or porn are not allowed anywhere
        on Aphrodite. Our moderators can move photos from one set to another, or
        block the photos completely if they don't respect our Terms of Use.
      </p><br/>

      <h3>How are photos &#38;#38; videos moderated?</h3>

      <p>
        All photos &#38;#38; videos are subject to our Terms &#38;#38;
        Conditions and our Code of Conduct. Our moderators will check all photos
        and videos you add. Posts can be moved or blocked when needed.

        this happens automatically! There's nothing you need to do, but adding a
        photo and filling out your info on your profile. What happens if I don’t
        like a profile in Explore? Nothing will happen, we will only make sure
        you're not proposed to one another again.
      </p><br/>

      <h3>What happens if I like someone that also likes me?</h3>

        like'. As soon as they've indicated they are also interested in you,
        you'll see them in 'Connections'.

        Live is the best way to interact in real time with many people at once.
        The people who like your profile will receive a notification when you go
        Live so they can tune in to your video. Moreover, Live videos are pushed
        to the front of Explore, giving you lots of extra views and likes.
      </p><br/>

        interested in you.

        see your photo or video only once, before it disappears forever.

        secure and awesome as we can, we need fantastic developers and they like
        to get paid for their services. That's why we offer a few paying
        features to further enhance your Aphrodite experience. TIP: larger
        packages and purchases with credit card are cheaper. SMS providers often
        charge extra costs.

      <h3>Is my payment secure?</h3>

      <p>
        Aphrodite uses completely secure partners to process your Premium or
        Credits payments. We never see your payment details, they are encrypted
        and processed securely to industry standard levels.
      </p><br/>

      <h3>What is my security (CVC/CID/CCV) code?</h3>

      <p>
        This is usually the last 3 digits on the back of your card (not
        embossed). Sometimes the code is on the front of your card. This simply
        ensures that you have your card with you and that it is you. It's
        another way we ensure your payment is secure.
      </p><br/>

      <h3>What is my 3D secure password?</h3>

      <p>
        Some banks add their own additional security measure into the payment
        process. They previously asked you to set a password for online
        payments, called a 3D secure password. If you can't remember this
        password, please contact your bank and try again later. I bought a
        product, but did not receive it. Products are activated shortly after
        your payment is successful. You’ll see a green success message telling
        you your feature has been activated. If you don’t see this message after
        a few minutes, please contact us at premium@aphrodite.com We will help
        you as soon as possible.

      <h3>How do I end my PayPal billing agreement with Aphrodite?</h3>

      <p>
        Note: Ending your billing agreement will mean we can no longer process
        your Aphrodite Premium payments via PayPal. You will also no longer be
        able to make one-click payments using PayPal. Follow these steps to end
        your PayPal billing agreement with Aphrodite: 1. Log in to your PayPal
        account 2. Select 'My account' and then 'Profile' 3. Select 'Account
        info' 4. Select 'My Pre-Approved Payments' 5. Select your billing
        agreement with Twoo from the list and then click 'cancel' to end the
        agreement. How do I remove my payment details from Aphrodite? If you
        agree to store a card or PayPal account for future purchases, we
        securely save your payment details so that you can pay more easily next
        time. You can delete your card details or PayPal account from your
        Settings. Please note that removing a payment method will not cancel any
        active subscription on the payment method. Contact us at
        premium@aphrodite.com if you encounter any issues with this.

      <p>

        the option to top you up when your balance gets low (below 300). If you
        want this feature, you can turn it on when you buy Credits, and you can
        turn it off at any time from your Settings page. Just uncheck the box
        next to 'Auto top-up'. Haven’t found an answer to your question? Send an

      <p>
        On all profiles and in all messages, you'll find a 'Block' link if you

        abuse' on the user's profile or in his/her private message. If you want
        to report someone that you can't find in your inbox anymore, you can
        contact us and include any useful information that might help us to
        identify this user. We'll make sure to look into it, but it might take a
        little longer than the direct reporting method described above.

        We always want to make sure that you get the most accurate results,
        adjusted to your location. You can choose to stop sharing your location
        with Aphrodite at any time. How to do this depends on the browser you
        are using, but you can usually find it in your browser settings or
        preferences.

      <h3>How can I keep myself safe?</h3>

      <h3>How are my exchanges with other users processed by Aphrodite?</h3>

      <p>
        Keeping you safe is and will always be a top priority. We use automated
        tools to scan interactions like messages and video calls solely for
        indications of harmful or illegal behaviour. Our trained agents may
        review interactions that are flagged by our automated tools or in
        response to a user report. We may use these examples to train our
        technology to improve our ability to find and remove similar content.
